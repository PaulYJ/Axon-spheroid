    <p/>This is the readme for NEURON and MATLAB model code for the paper
    
  <p/>Peng Yuan, Mengyang Zhang, Lei Tong, Thomas M. Morse, Robert
  A. McDougal, Hui Ding, Diane Chan, Yifei Cai, Jaime Grutzendler
  (2022) PLD3 impacts axonal spheroids and network defects in
  Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Nature

  <p/>The NEURON code was written by Tom Morse and the MATLAB code by
  Peng (Paul) Yuan and Tom Morse.

  <p/>To run the NEURON code download and extract this archive and
  compile the mod files with nrnivmodl. If you need more help than
  provided here please

  <p/><h3>Extended Data Figures 2a,b </h3>please run the
  mosinit.hoc with a command like

  <p/> nrngui mosinit.hoc

  <p/> The PAAS (plaque-associated axonal spheroid(s)) is represented
  in the model by a compartment called Can (as in tomato soup can)
  which is connected to the middle of an axon via a short process
  called Stick and these morphologies are displayed in a zoomed in
  shape plot above a voltage plot. A current clamp connected to the
  left end of the axon evokes one or more action potentials (APs). The
  voltage plot displays the AP(s) that is/are evoked in the left end of
  the dendrite (green voltage trace) and these propagate and are
  transmitted through the dystrophy or blocked.  The voltage on the
  right end of the axon is displayed in purple.

  The left, middle, and right extended data figure 2a single AP
  examples can be generated by pressing the appropriate button which
  automatically sets the PAAS diameter to 1e-7 (normal), 29 (delayed),
  and 40 (blocked) for the single AP cases. For 2b the spheroid
  diameter example is set to 53 um, which would also block a single AP,
  however will generate a delayed AP transmitted after multiple
  APs when supplied with a 20 Hz AP train input.

    Extended Data Figure 2e top</h3>
    <p/> Run the following program which takes about a day (or skip ahead to use provided stored results)
    <p/> nrngui alz_axon_serial_one_AP.hoc
    <p/> When finished run the following MATLAB command which will gather the results into MATLAB matricies
    <p/> load_data
    <p/> or you can start with the results that alz_axon_serial_one_AP.hoc would generate by reading in the workspace that was saved after we previously ran load_data, saved, and included that mat file in this archive
    <p/> load results/one_AP_input_results.mat
    <p/> then execute the graphics program
    <p/> [delaytime, apcount] = PlotAP(active_results, 0.15);
    <p/> which generates two figures, the second figure of which is similar to <b>extended data figure 2e top</b>

    <p/> <h3> Extended Data Figure 2e bottom</h3>
<p/> Run the following program which takes about a day (or skip ahead to use provided stored results)
    <p/> nrngui alz_axon_serial_20Hz.hoc
    <p/> When finished run the following MATLAB command which will gather the results into MATLAB matricies
    <p/> load_data
    <p/> or you can start with the results that alz_axon_serial_20Hz.hoc would generate by reading in the workspace that was saved after we previously ran load_data, saved, and included that mat file in this archive
    <p/> load results/20Hz_input_results.mat
